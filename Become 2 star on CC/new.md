7Ô∏è‚É£ Must-Know CP Shortcuts for A/B

Min/Max of two numbers: min(a, b) / max(a, b)

Swap without temp: swap(a, b)

Avoid overflow: divide before multiply in LCM

Binary operations basics (sometimes appear): even/odd check with n & 1

üí° Tip:
On Codeforces, A problems are usually one main trick + simple implementation.
B problems are one trick + small extra layer (edge cases or slightly bigger constraints).

If you want, I can make you a ‚ÄúCodeforces A/B Pattern Recognition Sheet‚Äù where I show 1 example per pattern, so you learn how to instantly identify which topic a problem belongs to when you read it.
That‚Äôll speed up solving from minutes to seconds.

Do you want me to prepare that sheet for you?

Gaurav sir,
the list I gave you already covers 90‚Äì95% of Codeforces A/B problems,
but yes ‚Äî there are a few extra small topics that show up sometimes in A/B problems which I didn‚Äôt explicitly write.

Here‚Äôs the extended + complete list so you don‚Äôt miss anything:

üîπ Extra Number Theory / Math Topics

LCM/GCD of more than two numbers (reduce in loop)

Modular inverse basics (only rare in B problems, but appears)

Digit-based problems

Sum of digits

Count digits

Reverse digits

Binary representation basics

Count set bits (__builtin_popcount)

Check if number is power of two (n & (n-1))

Greatest proper divisor (e.g., n / smallest prime factor)

LCM/GCD relationship with prime factors (very rare in A/B but sometimes appears)

üîπ Extra Array/Simulation Patterns

Rotation (shift array by k)

Cyclic patterns

One pass simulation of a process (e.g., moving tokens, changing values step-by-step)

Pairing elements under some rule (sum divisible by k, etc.)

Greedy sorting + condition check (like "sort and pair first with last")

üîπ Extra String Patterns

Anagrams (sort and compare)

Prefix/Suffix matching

Count vowels/consonants

Simple compression (count repeated chars)

Check if string can be rearranged into palindrome

üîπ Logical / Puzzle Type

Chessboard / grid basics

Even/odd cell color check

Manhattan distance

Parity games

If moves are even/odd

Yes/No pattern checking
Example: ‚ÄúCan you make all elements equal with given moves?‚Äù

Mathematical induction-like reasoning (proving smallest/largest possible answer)

üîπ CP Habits That Show Up in A/B

Always try smallest/largest input in your mind first

Convert ‚ÄúEnglish‚Äù condition into math
Example: ‚Äúb is multiple of a‚Äù ‚Üí b % a == 0

Look for one formula instead of simulating when constraints are huge
