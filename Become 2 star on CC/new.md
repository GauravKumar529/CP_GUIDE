1️⃣ Math & Number Theory (Super Common in A/B)

GCD / LCM

Euclidean Algorithm (iterative + recursive)

LCM formula: a / gcd(a, b) * b

Divisibility & Remainders

% operator tricks

Checking multiples in a range

Ceil / Floor calculations

Integer ceiling: (a + b - 1) / b

Parity

Odd/even number properties

Prime Numbers (Basic)

Check if prime

Sieve of Eratosthenes

Factorization Basics

Smallest divisor

Counting factors

Ranges of Multiples

Smallest multiple ≥ L, largest multiple ≤ R

Sum / Arithmetic Progression

n*(n+1)/2 and variations

Modular Arithmetic Basics

(a + b) % m, (a * b) % m rules

Simple Equations

Solving for x in small integer constraints

2️⃣ Arrays & Implementation

Finding Min/Max

Smallest, largest, second largest

Prefix Sum

For sums of subarrays

Sorting + Picking Elements

Sort and check first/last few

Counting Elements

Using map / frequency array

Adjacent Difference

Check pairs for conditions

Greedy Picks

Choose smallest/largest possible at each step

3️⃣ Strings (Light String Handling)

Character Counting

Frequency of letters

Palindrome Check

String Reversal

Checking Substring Presence

Comparing Strings

Sorting characters & comparing

Simple Transformations

Replace chars, case change

4️⃣ Greedy Thinking (Key for B problems)

Always pick smallest/largest possible that satisfies condition

Minimize or maximize with one pass

Split into two parts

“If possible, do it now” approach

5️⃣ Brute Force (When Constraints Allow)

O(n²) for n ≤ 1000

Trying all pairs/triples

Checking all subarrays

Simple simulation of moves

6️⃣ Special Common Patterns in A/B Problems

Two numbers in range with condition (divisibility, sum, gcd, lcm)

Find smallest number ≥ X with property

Check if array can be sorted with one operation

Find index of max/min

Count how many elements satisfy condition

Choose k smallest/largest

Rearrange elements to avoid a pattern

Simulate a process step-by-step

7️⃣ Must-Know CP Shortcuts for A/B

Min/Max of two numbers: min(a, b) / max(a, b)

Swap without temp: swap(a, b)

Avoid overflow: divide before multiply in LCM

Binary operations basics (sometimes appear): even/odd check with n & 1

💡 Tip:
On Codeforces, A problems are usually one main trick + simple implementation.
B problems are one trick + small extra layer (edge cases or slightly bigger constraints).

If you want, I can make you a “Codeforces A/B Pattern Recognition Sheet” where I show 1 example per pattern, so you learn how to instantly identify which topic a problem belongs to when you read it.
That’ll speed up solving from minutes to seconds.

Do you want me to prepare that sheet for you?

Gaurav sir,
the list I gave you already covers 90–95% of Codeforces A/B problems,
but yes — there are a few extra small topics that show up sometimes in A/B problems which I didn’t explicitly write.

Here’s the extended + complete list so you don’t miss anything:

🔹 Extra Number Theory / Math Topics

LCM/GCD of more than two numbers (reduce in loop)

Modular inverse basics (only rare in B problems, but appears)

Digit-based problems

Sum of digits

Count digits

Reverse digits

Binary representation basics

Count set bits (__builtin_popcount)

Check if number is power of two (n & (n-1))

Greatest proper divisor (e.g., n / smallest prime factor)

LCM/GCD relationship with prime factors (very rare in A/B but sometimes appears)

🔹 Extra Array/Simulation Patterns

Rotation (shift array by k)

Cyclic patterns

One pass simulation of a process (e.g., moving tokens, changing values step-by-step)

Pairing elements under some rule (sum divisible by k, etc.)

Greedy sorting + condition check (like "sort and pair first with last")

🔹 Extra String Patterns

Anagrams (sort and compare)

Prefix/Suffix matching

Count vowels/consonants

Simple compression (count repeated chars)

Check if string can be rearranged into palindrome

🔹 Logical / Puzzle Type

Chessboard / grid basics

Even/odd cell color check

Manhattan distance

Parity games

If moves are even/odd

Yes/No pattern checking
Example: “Can you make all elements equal with given moves?”

Mathematical induction-like reasoning (proving smallest/largest possible answer)

🔹 CP Habits That Show Up in A/B

Always try smallest/largest input in your mind first

Convert “English” condition into math
Example: “b is multiple of a” → b % a == 0

Look for one formula instead of simulating when constraints are huge
