✅ 1. Core Topics You MUST Cover
These will cover 90% of 2⭐-level problems:
1.	Math Basics
o	GCD, LCM (Euclidean Algorithm)
o	Modular arithmetic (a % m, (a+b)%m, (a*b)%m)
o	Fast Power (binary exponentiation for big exponents)
2.	Arrays & Prefix Sum
o	Range sum queries (prefix[i])
o	Subarray sum problems
o	Difference array (for range updates)
3.	Two Pointers / Sliding Window
o	Find subarray with sum ≤ K
o	Count pairs with condition (like abs(i-j) <= k)
4.	Greedy
o	Sorting + picking min/max
o	Interval scheduling style problems (choose earliest finishing time)
o	Coin change type logic (always pick largest possible first if optimal)
5.	Binary Search
o	Searching in sorted array
o	Binary Search on Answer (min/max days, capacity problems)
6.	Hashing / Frequency
o	Counting freq of elements using map/unordered_map
o	Detect duplicates
o	Majority element (Moore’s Voting)

✅ 2. Contest Strategy
•	First 2 Problems → Secure them (they’re usually direct math/arrays).
•	Always test on:
o	n=1
o	all values same
o	very large input
•	Skip if stuck >15 mins → move on.
________________________________________
✅ 3. Practice Routine
•	Solve 30–40 problems (difficulty 0–1400) → mix from:
o	CodeChef Beginner + Easy
o	Codeforces A + easy B
o	LeetCode Easy (prefix sum, two pointers)
________________________________________
✅ 4. Timeline (Fast Track to 2⭐)
•	Week 1–2 → Learn & practice prefix sum, greedy, two pointers.
•	Week 2–3 → Add binary search + hashing.
•	Every Contest → Target 2 problems solved.
Within 2–3 contests, if you’re consistent, your rating will cross 1400 = 2⭐ 🎯
________________________________________
⚡ Shortcut rule:
If you can confidently solve:
•	Prefix sum problem
•	Greedy sorting problem
•	Simple two-pointers problem
👉 You’re already contest-ready for 2⭐.
