A CP player will mentally tag it:

Is it math? (GCD, LCM, divisibility, remainders)

Is it greedy? (pick smallest/largest satisfying condition)

Is it implementation? (just simulate or count)

Is it search? (binary search, finding max/min meeting condition)
This classification comes in 2–3 seconds because they’ve seen similar patterns before

  Math Fundamentals

GCD & LCM (Euclidean algorithm, formula: lcm(a,b) = a/gcd(a,b) × b)

Divisibility (modulus % operator tricks)

Prime numbers (basic sieve)

Ceil & floor calculations

ceil(a / b) → (a + b - 1) / b in integers

Ranges & multiples (finding smallest multiple ≥ X, largest multiple ≤ Y)

Parity (odd/even patterns)

Sum of first n numbers formula: n(n+1)/2.
